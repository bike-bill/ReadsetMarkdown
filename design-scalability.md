| registered\_users | Number of registered users in the database.                                           |
| concurrent\_users | Number of users logged into the system at a given time.                               |
| map\_size         | Number of game squares in the playing area. E.g., a 10 x 25 map would be 250 squares. |

### Scalability Mechanisms {#scalability-mechanisms}

### Performance Goals and Estimates {#performance-goals-and-estimates}

| Action       | Goal       | Time Formula                | Description                                                               |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| login        | 1 second   | O(Log(registered\_users))   | Time that it takes to look up a user by their login name in the database. |
| display\_map | 1/5 second | O(map\_size + game\_pieces) | Time that it takes to redraw the game map and all game pieces.            |

How well do these mechanisms support the achievement of your goals?
:   2-4 SENTENCES

Have these scalability mechanisms been communicated to the development team and other stakeholders?
:   Yes, everyone understands. Feedback is welcome.
:   No, this is a risk that is noted in the [Risk
    Management](plan#risks) section.
