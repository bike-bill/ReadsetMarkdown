    further discussions. E.g., showing another team where their product

        rapid adoption.

        overall business process or that enable new
        business opportunities.

:   -   We have built only 4 of 10 screens, but the remaining screens
        are much easier to build.
    -   We have build 7 out of 10 features, and it turns out that one of
        the remaining features cannot possibly work like the others.

How much time is available to present the demo?
:   10 minutes, no questions
:   10 minutes, plus questions
:   30 minutes, including questions

What equipment and setup is needed to give the demo?
:   One person. Any computer with a web browser.
:   One person. Any computer where we can install from CD or
    the Internet.

    pre-installed, a wireless networking base station, and a hand-held
    with a wireless networking card.

as needed, and that there is enough time.

being shown at each step? Is the demo too fast? Too slow? Too long? Are
you interested? What are your questions or concerns? Do you strongly
disagree with any points?

    if needed.

    fewer points.

Do all system features actually work as needed?
:   Yes, everything is finished and working.
:   Yes, there are defects, but they will not matter for this demo.
:   Don't know, we need to plan alternative demo steps just in case
    something fails.

    our points without exposing defects.

Does the demo end effectively?
:   Yes, viewers will be satisfied and convinced.
:   No, we need to make sure the demo stops at the natural end of a
    small but complete story, and that audience members understand our
    key points.

Does the demo raise questions that it does not answer?
:   No, the demo is very complete.
:   Yes, but we anticipate those questions and can handle them in the
    Q&A period.

    will then work to resolve.
