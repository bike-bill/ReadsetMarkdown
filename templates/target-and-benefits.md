[Risks and Rewards](plan.html#risks).

TIP: If you can rank benefits by value, use numbered lists (the HTML
&lt;ol&gt; tag), otherwise use bullet lists (the HTML &lt;ul&gt; tag).

-   Increases play-value
    -   Many players enjoy games more when they play as a team.
    -   Clans can greatly extend the time that a player plays one game,
        thus reducing the expense of buying new games.
-   Improves customer population
    1.  Clan players often encourage their friends to play the same
        game, which gives game vendors more revenue.
    2.  Clans help to organize the customer population and create
        channels of communication so that vendor information (e.g.,
        about future releases) spreads more quickly with less
        advertising expense and delay.
    3.  Clans attract the more experienced players who can give better
        feedback to game vendors.

### Potential Downside {#potential-downside}

TODO: Could anyone be harmed or put at a disadvantage because of your
system? List as above. Note, these are not risks to the success of your
implementation, assume that you build the system as specified on time.

-   Privacy
    -   When players opt into clans, they also opt into receiving
        marketing information from game vendors. Usually this is a good
        thing if the players are interested, but it can also
        be annoying.
    -   Cheaters will be publicly named as cheaters and blocked from
        game servers, thus they lose the ability to play/cheat.
-   Type of downside
    1.  Worst downside
    2.  Downside
