### Overview {#overview}

TODO: Answer the questions below to help you define your source code
organization and build process. Some example text is provided. Add or
delete text as needed. E.g., not all projects try to be platform
independent.

What are the most important facts that a developer should know about this source code organization and build system?
:   It roughly follows the standard proposed in the Tomcat documentation
    and is very similar to the organization used on many open source
    projects at the Apache Software Foundation.

What are the ranked goals of this source code organization and build system?

:   1.  Separation of files by type
    2.  Separation of version-controlled files from files generated by
        the build process
    3.  Compatibility with standard build processes
    4.  Platform independence

### Key Directories and Files in Developer Working Copies {#key-directories-and-files-in-developer-working-copies}

TODO: Describe the purpose of each directory that will appear in a
developer's work copy, also include any files that are important to the
overall structure or build process.

|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| compile = default | Compiles Java source code and creates .class files under the "build" directory.                                                                                                                                                  |
| dist              | Packages the system for distribution/deployment to servers or end users. Specifically, it creates .war archive of compiled classes and configuration files.                                                                      |
| install           | Places executable code into location where it will actually be executed. Specifically, it copies .war file into Tomcat's webapps directory for use. You must then restart Tomcat or use the "reload" link in the Tomcat Manager. |
| javadoc           | Generates Java API documentation under "build/docs/api/".                                                                                                                                                                        |

|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| app.name     | The name of this application. This should be one short word. Used in the name of resulting package files. Specifically, the .war file. And, it will be used to access the application via http://localhost:8080/APP.NAME/ |
| app.version  | Version number of this release. Used in the name of resulting package files. Specifically, the .war file.                                                                                                                 |

These build system properties can be modified by editing the
build.properties file.

### Source Code Organization and Build System Checklist {#source-code-organization-and-build-system-checklist}

Separation of files by type: Are files separated by type?
:   Yes. Except that application JSP and HTML files are in the same
    directory, which is convenient because sometimes we change an HTML
    file to be a JSP file.

Separation of version-controlled and non-version controlled files: To what extent has this been achieved?
:   It has been achieved. Everything is under version control except for
    the "build" directory. No step in the build process should create or
    modify any file in any other directory.

Compatibility with standard build processes: To what extent has this been achieved?
:   So far, so good. We can use build.xml files that are very close to
    the examples that come with Ant. One difference is that we keep our
    technical documentation under "www" rather than under "docs". Also,
    we have avoided the use of custom ant tasks.

Platform independence: To what extent has this been achieved?
:   We are using Ant, which is itself platform independent. The names of
    the files and directories should work across platforms because they
    do not rely on case-sensitive names. We assume that the utility
    scripts in the "scripts" directory support all needed platforms and
    we have not created directories for different versions of these
    files aimed at specific platforms.

Have these implementation decisions been communicated to the development team and other stakeholders?
:   Yes, everyone understands. Feedback is welcome.
:   No, this is a risk that is noted in the [Risk
    Management](plan.html#risks) section.
