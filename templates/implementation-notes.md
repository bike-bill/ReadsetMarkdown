**Process impact:** This document is a brief and fairly technical
discussion of how the system works under ideal conditions. It is also
known as a "theory of operation" document. It should describe key
algorithms, technology dependencies, and operational issues. Much of the
content of this document can be drawn from design documents. This
document will be used by the QA, technical support, and operations
groups. The goal is to give those groups the information they need to
understand, manage, or begin to troubleshoot the system (i.e., recognize
certain behavior as normal or abnormal). If significantly more
information is needed, it should be organized into a larger "operations
guide".

### Type of Implementation {#type-of-implementation}

TODO: Fill in information that will help other engineers understand this
system at-a-glance. Feel free to use relevant technical terms and name
specific technology platforms.

### Implementation of Specific Features {#implementation-of-specific-features}

TODO: Write short descriptions of interesting or unexpected algorithms,
limiting assumptions, or any other implementation detail that will
impact the work of other groups. E.g., long-running operations that must
not be interrupted. E.g., start up or shutdown scripts that are
automatically run by the operating system.

### Security {#security}

We take the following precautions to make the system secure:

-   STEP
-   STEP
-   STEP

The security of the system depends on the following external factors:

### Performance and Scalability {#performance-and-scalability}

### Implementation Notes Checklist {#implementation-notes-checklist}

Do these implementation notes provide enough information for operations engineers?
:   Yes, these notes have been reviewed by the operations team and
    requested changes have been incorporated.
:   No, these notes only summarize parts of a larger [operations
    manual](LINK-TO-OPERTIONS-MANUAL).
:   No, a member of the development team is available on-call whenever
    the operations team may need help. This is listed in the [Resource
    Needs](resource-needs.html) document and in the [on-call
    schedule](LINK-TO-ON-CALL-SCHEDULE).

Have these implementation notes been communicated to the operations and development teams and other stakeholders?
:   Yes, everyone has had a chance to review them. Feedback is welcome.
:   Yes, it has been posted to the project website.
:   No, some developers or operations engineers are not aware of
    this document. This is a risk that is noted in the [Risk
    Management](plan.html#risks) section of the [Project
    Plan](plan.html).

TODO: Check for [words of
wisdom](http://readyset.tigris.org/words-of-wisdom/implementation-notes.html)
and discuss ways to improve this template. Or, evaluate the ReadySET Pro
[professional implementation notes
template](http://www.readysetpro.com/ "pro use case template and sample test plan").
