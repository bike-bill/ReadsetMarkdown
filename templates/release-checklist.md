**Process impact:** The process of working through this checklist helps
uncover any remaining concerns before the release, and reminds internal
stakeholders of their upcoming responsibilities. Once this checklist has
been satisfied, this release may be sent to manufacturing and sold to
customers with the full support of the organization.

TODO: Discuss each item with the relevant stakeholders and update its
status. Add comments as needed to record important decisions or link to
resulting documents. Add new items as needed for your particular project
or process. Any uncovered problems or tasks should be tracked in the
issue tracker.

    unimportant

TIP: If a stakeholder hits difficulties with this release after it goes
out, add those issues to the checklist template so that everyone knows
that they will be explicitly managed on the next release. Conduct a
postmortem review to help expose difficulties rather than repeat them.

TIP: You might consider some of the following additional stakeholders at
your organization: Other engineering groups (i.e., hardware design),
Manufacturing and Shipping, Software Process Improvement, Key customers
and partners, External developers, Risk Management, Business
Development, and Upper Management.
