TODO: Briefly describe each component in the system. Focus on
architectural issues such as communication mechanisms, environmental
concerns that affect deployment options, and concurrency. Note key
aspects of each interface, but avoid duplicating details of interfaces
that are specified in the UML class diagrams or other documents.

Each interface can be an API (application program interface), standard
protocol (e.g., HTTP), config files, input data file format, or
interactive user interface (e.g., command-line or GUI). One component
may have multiple interfaces: e.g., a server may handle requests in a
standard protocol, but also have a config file, command-line options, an
administrative control panel GUI, and a performance monitoring API.

TIP: Use an HTML anchor for each component so that a direct link can be
made from other documents, issues, and email messages.
